# Real Dataset Integration - Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

We successfully replaced the mock `get_mock_related_reactions()` function with a real dataset-based implementation that uses the actual Buchwald-Hartwig reactions from `data/buchwald_reactions.csv`.

### âœ… Key Features Implemented

1. **Real Chemical Similarity Calculation**
   - Uses RDKit Morgan fingerprints (2048-bit, radius 2)
   - Calculates Tanimoto similarity for both reactants and products
   - Combined similarity score (average of reactant + product similarity)
   - Sorts results by highest similarity first

2. **Robust Dataset Integration**
   - Loads 500+ real Buchwald-Hartwig reactions from CSV
   - Handles JSON-formatted fields (catalyst, ligand, solvent)
   - Extracts experimental data (yield, temperature, time, reference)
   - Provides comprehensive reaction information

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Falls back to text-based similarity if RDKit is unavailable
   - Falls back to mock data if dataset loading fails
   - Graceful error handling throughout

4. **Enhanced Information Display**
   - Shows real experimental yields, catalysts, and ligands
   - Displays reaction conditions (temperature, time, solvent)
   - Includes reaction IDs and literature references
   - Shows similarity scores as percentages

### ðŸ”§ New Functions Added

1. **`get_related_reactions_from_dataset(input_smiles, top_k=2)`**
   - Main function that finds similar reactions from real dataset
   - Uses RDKit for chemical similarity calculation
   - Returns top-k most similar reactions with full experimental data

2. **`_parse_json_field(json_str)`**
   - Handles JSON array fields from the CSV dataset
   - Safely extracts catalyst/ligand/solvent information
   - Provides fallback for various data formats

3. **`_get_fallback_similar_reactions(df, input_smiles, top_k)`**
   - Alternative similarity when RDKit is not available
   - Uses deterministic hash-based selection
   - Still provides real experimental data from dataset

### ðŸ“Š Dataset Details

- **File**: `data/buchwald_reactions.csv`
- **Size**: 500+ real Buchwald-Hartwig reactions
- **Columns**: ReactionID, ReactantSMILES, ProductSMILES, Yield_%, CoreDetail (catalyst), Ligand, Solvent, Temperature_C, Time_h, Reference, and more
- **Format**: JSON arrays for multi-value fields, standard CSV for others

### ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **User inputs a reaction** (e.g., from sample browser or manual entry)
2. **System runs prediction** (existing functionality)
3. **After prediction**, the system automatically:
   - Calls `get_related_reactions_from_dataset()` 
   - Calculates chemical similarity to all 500+ reactions in dataset
   - Returns top 2 most similar reactions
   - Displays them with reaction images and experimental details

### ðŸ”„ Integration Points

The new dataset functionality is integrated into:
- `on_prediction_finished()` - automatically shows related reactions after prediction
- Enhanced display in `display_related_reactions()` - shows comprehensive experimental data
- Fallback chain: Dataset â†’ Mock data (if dataset fails)

### ðŸš€ Benefits Over Mock Data

- **Real chemical similarity** instead of random selection
- **Actual experimental conditions** from literature
- **Meaningful similarity scores** based on molecular fingerprints  
- **Literature references** for further reading
- **Reproducible results** based on chemical structure

### ðŸ“¦ Dependencies Added

Added to `requirements.txt`:
- `pandas>=1.5.0` - for CSV data handling
- `rdkit-pypi>=2022.9.1` - for chemical similarity calculation

### ðŸ§ª Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified:
- âœ… GUI loads and runs successfully
- âœ… Dataset loads 500 reactions correctly
- âœ… RDKit similarity calculation works
- âœ… Related reactions display properly
- âœ… Fallback mechanisms function correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Cache similarity calculations for performance
   - Add more sophisticated similarity measures
   - Include reaction context (functional groups, aromatic systems)
   - Filter by experimental success (high-yield reactions only)

2. **Future Expansion**:
   - Add datasets for other reaction types (Suzuki, Heck, etc.)
   - Implement substructure-based similarity
   - Add reaction classification based on structural features

The system now provides **real, chemically-meaningful related reactions** from actual experimental data, making it much more valuable for synthetic chemists planning their reactions.
